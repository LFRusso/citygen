# CityGen

An application for generating realistic road networks that mixes rule-based generation with a multi-agent simulation of work-consume-rest behaviour in the artifficial city.

## Usage

### 1. Installing dependencies 

The application is built for `Python 3.8` or above. To install the required libraries execute in the root directory:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Running 

To run the simulation, follow the example shown in the file `run.py`, creating the Generator object and running the episodes (each comprised of a generation and a simulation step).

## Configurations

1. `config.json` file

2. Model parameters

3. Configuring the simulation
